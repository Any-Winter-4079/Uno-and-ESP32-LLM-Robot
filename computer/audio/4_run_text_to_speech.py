"""
Text-to-Speech (TTS) Evaluation Script

Generates speech audio from text using various Coqui TTS models.

Features:
- Runs on CPU, CUDA, or MPS
- Supports multiple models (xtts_v2, your_tts, tortoise-v2, speedy-speech)
- Logs processing time and real-time factor (RTF)
- Can use voice cloning (speaker_wav) for multi-lingual models
